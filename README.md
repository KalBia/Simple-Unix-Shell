## Simple Unix Shell
Technology: C
Type of project: fill-in-the-gaps

### Rules of project
Only the code inside the "STUDENT" zones is written from scratch by me. The professor provided everything else.

### How to use it
make - compile the project
make format - format all .c files
make test - run tests given by the professor (it requires that the code outside the "STUDENT" zones is unmodified, even adding comments is forbidden)
